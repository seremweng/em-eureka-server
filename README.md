# EM Eureka Server

**EM Eureka Server** is a Spring Cloud-based **Service Registry** built using **Netflix Eureka**. It serves as a central hub where all microservices in the EM ecosystem can **register** and **discover** each other dynamically. This is crucial in a microservice architecture to enable communication without hard-coded service locations.
